## What is CI/CD.
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment. It is a software development practice where code changes are 
automatically built, tested, and deployed to production.One of Cypress’s most essential and powerful use cases is having it 
run in your CI/CD pipeline. This way, every time you make a change to your codebase, your CI Pipeline will automatically 
run all of your Cypress tests to ensure that nothing has broken in your application


## What is GitHub Actions?
GitHub Actions is a Continuous Integration (build, test, merge) and Continuous Delivery (automatically released to the repository) 
(CI/CD) platform.It automates and executes the software development workflows right from GitHub.
                                              With GitHub Actions, you can build, test, and publish across multiple platforms
operating systems, and languages all within the same workflow and then see the status checks displayed within the pull request.

# Some of the features of GitHub Actions are:
- Ease of setup. There is no installation required as it is on the cloud.
- Support of multiple languages and frameworks.
- Provides actions to every GitHub event.
- It can be shared via GitHub Marketplace.
- No explicit plugin is required for caching. You can write your own caching mechanism if you require caching.
- Asynchronous CI/CD is achieved using GitHub Actions.
